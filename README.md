# Semester Project 2 - "Art Auctions"
This is my Semester Project 2. A Front End assignment for users to Register, Login, create an entry and bid on others.

# Goal
To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

# Status Badges


# Brief
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

# Requirements
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
